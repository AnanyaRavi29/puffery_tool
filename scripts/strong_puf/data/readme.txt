Strong PUF Data README:

Description of available datasets:

1) crp_c16_r1: 16-bit challenge, 1-bit response arbiter PUF collected using 
   HSPICE simulation and Python post-processing.
   
2) crp_hash: 16-bit challenge, 1-bit response from Python based model data 
   of an SRAM PUF which uses the challenges as a means to select a row in the 
   SRAM. Data was generated by gen_hash_based_response.py
   
3) crp_random: 16-bit challenge, 1-bit response dataset which uses the same
   challenges as crp_c16_r1 but the responses are randomly generated. This
   dataset represents an upperbound for any PUF as there is no correlation
   between challenge and response.
   
4) crp_arb: 16-bit challenge, 1-bit response from an Arbiter PUF from HSPICE 
simulated data in FreePDK45 technology.   
   
Notes:
All datasets are have a 16-bit challenge and 1-bit response. The challenge size
was made small to allow SPICE simulations to be faster. This is considered small
challenge size and will increased at a later point.

All datasets have a 1-bit responses. This was done to make analysis unambiguous.
As response size increases, then other metrics needs to be incorporated and changes
in the learning models. This will be increased later as well when the scripts have 
been updated.
